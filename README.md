# rail-fence-transposition-cipher
The Rail Fence Cipher, also known as the Zigzag Cipher, is a simple transposition cipher technique used for encrypting and decrypting messages. It derives its name from the way the text is arranged in a zigzag pattern that resembles a fence made of rails. Here's how the Rail Fence Cipher works:


Encryption Process:

Key Selection: The encryption process begins by choosing a positive integer key (usually referred to as the "number of rails" or "rail count"). This key determines the number of rows in the rail fence pattern.

Creating the Rail Fence: The rail fence consists of rows equal to the key, initially filled with placeholder characters (e.g., spaces or newline characters) to create an empty zigzag pattern.

Filling the Zigzag Pattern: Starting from the top rail (row), characters from the plaintext message are placed diagonally in the matrix, following the zigzag pattern. The direction of movement alternates between moving downward and upward as you fill the rows. When you reach the last rail, you reverse the direction.

Reading the Ciphertext: To obtain the ciphertext, you read the characters row by row from the matrix, resulting in the encrypted message.

Decryption Process:

Key Selection: You need to know the key that was used for encryption to decrypt the message.

Creating the Rail Fence: Create an empty rail fence matrix with the same number of rows as the key.

Marking the Zigzag Path: Similar to the encryption process, mark the positions in the matrix where characters would have been placed during encryption with a marker symbol (e.g., '*').

Placing the Ciphertext: Place the characters from the ciphertext into the marked positions, following the zigzag path.

Reading the Plaintext: Read the matrix in a zigzag pattern to obtain the original plaintext message.

Example:

Let's illustrate the Rail Fence Cipher with an example:

Encryption (Key = 3):

Plaintext: "HELLO"
Rail Fence Pattern:
mathematica
Copy code
H . . . O
. E . L .
. . L . .
Ciphertext: "HOELLN"
Decryption (Key = 3):

Ciphertext: "HOELLN"
Rail Fence Pattern (marked):
markdown
Copy code
H * * * O
* E * L *
* * L * *
Rail Fence Pattern (filled):
mathematica
Copy code
H . . . O
. E . L .
. . L . .
Plaintext: "HELLO"
The Rail Fence Cipher is relatively easy to understand and implement, but it may not provide strong security for modern cryptographic purposes and is more of a historical or educational cipher.
